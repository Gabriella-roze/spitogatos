# Initialization

I used ViteJS to make the development experience smoother. It provides hot reloading so I could see changes while coding in real-time. Also, it is easy to build a production-ready bundle and to deploy anywhere I want. I also added a plugin that adds browser auto prefixes wherever it is needed.

I decided to not use any CSS libraries. That is to expose my CSS skills. In a real project, I would use something like tailwind to speed up the development process.

I added bootstrap just to quickly create a carousel. Since I didn't have any specific content to display in slides, bootstrap was a quick and easy solution.

# Form validation

To validate the form I wrote my version of form validation in validation.js. I used a basic alert function to display a simple alert if the form was submitted successfully. In real projects, I would probably use a form library, like Formik (react only) which would save a lot of time. It also was created by Jared Palmer who is a developer I follow and would trust his code.

# What's next?

If I had more time:

- I would try to import only the carousel module out of bootstrap or I would create my carousel or use a small library that is only for the carousel. In my opinion, importing a whole library for a single component is not very efficient.

- As I mentioned before, I would use Tailwind for styling the site faster.

- I would work on the interactions a bit more, making it a bit more "wow" and pixel perfect. It would be easier if I could have a few backs and forth with the designer.

- I would also improve on the navigation menu, maybe splitting the navigation into separate components for desktop and mobile. Also, I would add nicer animations for mobile navigation on open/close.

# Thanks!

Thanks for the opportunity. I had a great time working on the assignment. Any feedback would be appreciated :)
